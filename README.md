# Non-linear-equations
In this code I provide all Close and Open methods to solve Non Linear equations. 

The Close methods are: 1) Bisection, 2) Regula Falsi. 
The Open methods are: 1) Fixed Point, 2) Newton&Raphson, 3) Secant, 4) Muller.

note: specify your equations inside function.py

This is a project for the Numerical Analysis course in the fourth semester of the Mechanical Engineering department at Ntua.
